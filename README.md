# US-Medical-Insurance-Costs
Group data science project for Machine Learning and AI Fundamentals skill path at Codecademy using Jupyter Notebook and CSV data

## Goals
Upon exploring the dataset we thought it would be intersting to see if there was a bias in the data around BMI and insurance costs. Perhaps there is an outdate measure being used by insurance companies to calculate premiums.
